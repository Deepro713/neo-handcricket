# neo-handcricket — Decision Log

Architecture Decision Records, newest first. One per cluster/significant decision.

## ADR-0001 — Adopt the looped autonomous-dev process
**Date:** 2026-06-07 · **Status:** accepted
Adopt the Streetbound-style process for neo-handcricket: the vault (`docs/`) as source of truth,
milestones (zero-padded, one minor bump each) shipped as small per-cluster PRs through a four-part QA
gate (ruff + mypy + pytest + a headless game-sim playtest), an ADR per cluster, a GitHub Project board
with per-milestone status updates, an auto-published wiki, and a perpetual research→plan→build loop
driven by `/loop` in a dedicated terminal. Guardrails: single-player/offline, CC0/original content,
no infra-credential changes. See `conventions-and-rules.md` + `dev-runbook.md`.
